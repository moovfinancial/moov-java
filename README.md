## Summary

Moov API: Moov is a platform that enables developers to integrate all aspects of money movement with ease and speed.
The Moov API makes it simple for platforms to send, receive, and store money. Our API is based upon REST
principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. To learn more about how Moov
works at a high level, read our [concepts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/glossary/) guide.

For more information about the API: [Moov Guides and API Documentation](https://docs.moov.io/)

## SDK Installation

### Getting started

JDK 11 or later is required.

The samples below show how a published SDK artifact is used:

Gradle:
```groovy
implementation 'io.moov:sdk:25.1.6'
```

Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.moov</groupId>
    <artifactId>sdk</artifactId>
    <version>25.1.6</version>
</dependency>
```

### How to build
After cloning the git repository to your file system you can build the SDK artifact from source to the `build` directory by running `./gradlew build` on *nix systems or `gradlew.bat` on Windows systems.

If you wish to build from source and publish the SDK artifact to your local Maven repository (on your filesystem) then use the following command (after cloning the git repo locally):

On *nix:
```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -Pskip.signing
```
On Windows:
```bash
gradlew.bat publishToMavenLocal -Pskip.signing
```

## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```java
package hello.world;

import io.moov.sdk.Moov;
import io.moov.sdk.models.components.*;
import io.moov.sdk.models.errors.CreateAccountError;
import io.moov.sdk.models.errors.GenericError;
import io.moov.sdk.models.operations.CreateAccountResponse;
import java.lang.Exception;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws GenericError, CreateAccountError, Exception {

        Moov sdk = Moov.builder()
                .xMoovVersion("v2024.01.00")

<!-- Start Authentication [security] -->
## Authentication

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name                      | Type | Scheme     |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------- |
| `username`<br/>`password` | http | HTTP Basic |

You can set the security parameters through the `security` builder method when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```java
package hello.world;

import io.moov.sdk.Moov;
import io.moov.sdk.models.components.*;
import io.moov.sdk.models.errors.CreateAccountError;
import io.moov.sdk.models.errors.GenericError;
import io.moov.sdk.models.operations.CreateAccountResponse;
import java.lang.Exception;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws GenericError, CreateAccountError, Exception {

        Moov sdk = Moov.builder()
                .security(Security.builder()
                    .username("")
                    .password("")
                    .build())
                .xMoovVersion("v2024.01.00")
            .build();

        CreateAccount req = CreateAccount.builder()
                .accountType(AccountType.BUSINESS)
                .profile(CreateProfile.builder()
                    .business(CreateBusinessProfile.builder()
                        .legalBusinessName("Whole Body Fitness LLC")
                        .build())
                    .build())
                .build();

        CreateAccountResponse res = sdk.accounts().create()
                .request(req)
                .call();

        if (res.account().isPresent()) {
            // handle response
        }
    }
}
```

you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.write` scope.
* [initiateMicroDeposits](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiatemicrodeposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. 
Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account 
you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any 
time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously
initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits)
guide for more information.

* [getVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#getverification) - Retrieve the current status and details of an instant verification, including whether the verification method was instant (RTP or FedNow) or same-day
ACH. This helps track the verification process in real-time and provides details in case of exceptions.

The status will indicate the following:

- `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending to the payment network
- `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification
- `failed`: Verification failed, description provided, user needs to add a new bank account
- `expired`: Verification expired after 14 days, initiate another verification
- `max-attempts-exceeded`: Five incorrect code attempts exhausted, initiate another verification

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP, FedNow, or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank's capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
  response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP or FedNow
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

To access this endpoint using an [access token](https://docs.moov.io/api/authentication/access-tokens/) 
you'll need to specify the `/accounts/{accountID}/bank-accounts.write` scope.
* [completeVerification](docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#completeverification) - Finalize the instant micro-deposit verification by submitting the verification code displayed in the user's bank account. 

Upon successful verification, the bank account status will be updated to `verified` and eligible for ACH debit transactions.

The following formats are accepted:
- `MV0000`
- `mv0000`
- `0000`

* [link](docs/sdks/cards/README.md#link) - Link a card to an existing Moov account. 

Read our [accept card payments guide](https://docs.moov.io/guides/sources/cards/accept-card-payments/#link-a-card) to learn more.

Only use this endpoint if you have provided Moov with a copy of your PCI attestation of compliance. 

During card linking, the provided data will be verified by submitting a $0 authorization (account verification) request. 
If `merchantAccountID` is provided, the authorization request will contain that account's statement descriptor and address. 
Otherwise, the platform account's profile will be used. If no statement descriptor has been set, the authorization will 
use the account's name instead.

It is strongly recommended that callers include the `X-Wait-For` header, set to `payment-method`, if the newly linked 
card is intended to be used right away. If this header is not included, the caller will need to poll the [List Payment 
Methods](https://docs.moov.io/api/sources/payment-methods/list/)
endpoint to wait for the new payment methods to be available for use.

When you run this request, you retrieve 200 transfers at a time. You can advance past a results set of 200 transfers by using the `skip` parameter (for example, 
if you set `skip`= 10, you will see a results set of 200 transfers after the first 10). If you are searching a high volume of transfers, the request will likely 
process very slowly. To achieve faster performance, restrict the data as much as you can by using the `StartDateTime` and `EndDateTime` parameters for a limited 
period of time. You can run multiple requests in smaller time window increments until you've retrieved all the transfers you need.

## Error Handling

Handling errors in this SDK should largely match your expectations. All operations return a response object or raise an exception.


[`MoovError`](./src/main/java/models/errors/MoovError.java) is the base class for all HTTP error responses. It has the following properties:

| Method           | Type                        | Description                                                              |
| ---------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `message()`      | `String`                    | Error message                                                            |
| `code()`         | `int`                       | HTTP response status code eg `404`                                       |
| `headers`        | `Map<String, List<String>>` | HTTP response headers                                                    |
| `body()`         | `byte[]`                    | HTTP body as a byte array. Can be empty array if no body is returned.    |
| `bodyAsString()` | `String`                    | HTTP body as a UTF-8 string. Can be empty string if no body is returned. |
| `rawResponse()`  | `HttpResponse<?>`           | Raw HTTP response (body already read and not available for re-read)      |

## Server Selection

### Override Server URL Per-Client

The default server can be overridden globally using the `.serverURL(String serverUrl)` builder method when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```java
package hello.world;

import io.moov.sdk.Moov;
import io.moov.sdk.models.components.*;
import io.moov.sdk.models.errors.CreateAccountError;
import io.moov.sdk.models.errors.GenericError;
import io.moov.sdk.models.operations.CreateAccountResponse;
import java.lang.Exception;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws GenericError, CreateAccountError, Exception {

        Moov sdk = Moov.builder()
                .serverURL("https://api.moov.io")
                .xMoovVersion("v2024.01.00")
                .security(Security.builder()
                    .username("")
                    .password("")
                    .build())
            .build();

        CreateAccount req = CreateAccount.builder()
                .accountType(AccountType.BUSINESS)
                .profile(CreateProfile.builder()
                    .business(CreateBusinessProfile.builder()
                        .legalBusinessName("Whole Body Fitness LLC")
                        .build())
                    .build())
                .build();

        CreateAccountResponse res = sdk.accounts().create()
                .request(req)
                .call();

        if (res.account().isPresent()) {
            // handle response
        }
    }
}
```

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->
## Custom HTTP Client

The Java SDK makes API calls using an `HTTPClient` that wraps the native
[HttpClient](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.net.http/java/net/http/HttpClient.html). This
client provides the ability to attach hooks around the request lifecycle that can be used to modify the request or handle
errors and response.

The `HTTPClient` interface allows you to either use the default `SpeakeasyHTTPClient` that comes with the SDK,
or provide your own custom implementation with customized configuration such as custom executors, SSL context,
connection pools, and other HTTP client settings.

The interface provides synchronous (`send`) methods.

The following example shows how to add a custom header and handle errors:

```java
import io.moov.sdk.Moov;
import io.moov.sdk.utils.HTTPClient;
import io.moov.sdk.utils.SpeakeasyHTTPClient;
import io.moov.sdk.utils.Utils;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.time.Duration;

public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a custom HTTP client with hooks
        HTTPClient httpClient = new HTTPClient() {
            private final HTTPClient defaultClient = new SpeakeasyHTTPClient();
            
            @Override
            public HttpResponse<InputStream> send(HttpRequest request) throws IOException, URISyntaxException, InterruptedException {
                // Add custom header and timeout using Utils.copy()
                HttpRequest modifiedRequest = Utils.copy(request)
                    .header("x-custom-header", "custom value")
                    .timeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
                    .build();
                    
                try {
                    HttpResponse<InputStream> response = defaultClient.send(modifiedRequest);
                    // Log successful response
                    System.out.println("Request successful: " + response.statusCode());
                    return response;
                } catch (Exception error) {
                    // Log error
                    System.err.println("Request failed: " + error.getMessage());
                    throw error;
                }
            }
        };

        Moov sdk = Moov.builder()
            .client(httpClient)
            .build();
    }
}
```

<details>
<summary>Custom HTTP Client Configuration</summary>

You can also provide a completely custom HTTP client with your own configuration:

```java
import io.moov.sdk.Moov;
import io.moov.sdk.utils.HTTPClient;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.net.URISyntaxException;
import java.net.http.HttpClient;
import java.net.http.HttpRequest;
import java.net.http.HttpResponse;
import java.io.InputStream;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Custom HTTP client with custom configuration
        HTTPClient customHttpClient = new HTTPClient() {
            private final HttpClient client = HttpClient.newBuilder()
                .executor(Executors.newFixedThreadPool(10))
                .connectTimeout(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
                // .sslContext(customSslContext) // Add custom SSL context if needed
                .build();

            @Override
            public HttpResponse<InputStream> send(HttpRequest request) throws IOException, URISyntaxException, InterruptedException {
                return client.send(request, HttpResponse.BodyHandlers.ofInputStream());
            }
        };

        Moov sdk = Moov.builder()
            .client(customHttpClient)
            .build();
    }
}
```

</details>

You can also enable debug logging on the default `SpeakeasyHTTPClient`:

```java
import io.moov.sdk.Moov;
import io.moov.sdk.utils.SpeakeasyHTTPClient;

public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpeakeasyHTTPClient httpClient = new SpeakeasyHTTPClient();
        httpClient.enableDebugLogging(true);

        Moov sdk = Moov.builder()
            .client(httpClient)
            .build();
    }
}
```
<!-- End Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->

<!-- Start Debugging [debug] -->
## Debugging

### Debug

You can setup your SDK to emit debug logs for SDK requests and responses.

For request and response logging (especially json bodies), call `enableHTTPDebugLogging(boolean)` on the SDK builder like so:

```java
SDK.builder()
    .enableHTTPDebugLogging(true)
    .build();
```
Example output:
```
Sending request: http://localhost:35123/bearer#global GET
Request headers: {Accept=[application/json], Authorization=[******], Client-Level-Header=[added by client], Idempotency-Key=[some-key], x-speakeasy-user-agent=[speakeasy-sdk/java 0.0.1 internal 0.1.0 org.openapis.openapi]}
Received response: (GET http://localhost:35123/bearer#global) 200
Response headers: {access-control-allow-credentials=[true], access-control-allow-origin=[*], connection=[keep-alive], content-length=[50], content-type=[application/json], date=[Wed, 09 Apr 2025 01:43:29 GMT], server=[gunicorn/19.9.0]}
Response body:
{
  "authenticated": true, 
  "token": "global"
}
```
__WARNING__: This logging should only be used for temporary debugging purposes. Leaving this option on in a production system could expose credentials/secrets in logs. <i>Authorization</i> headers are redacted by default and there is the ability to specify redacted header names via `SpeakeasyHTTPClient.setRedactedHeaders`.

__NOTE__: This is a convenience method that calls `HTTPClient.enableDebugLogging()`. The `SpeakeasyHTTPClient` honors this setting. If you are using a custom HTTP client, it is up to the custom client to honor this setting.


Another option is to set the System property `-Djdk.httpclient.HttpClient.log=all`. However, this second option does not log bodies.

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Any manual changes added to internal files will be overwritten on the next generation. 
We look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to open a PR or an issue with a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release.
